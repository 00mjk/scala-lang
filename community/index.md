# The Scala Community

### Introduction to the Scala Community

You will enjoy being part of the Scala community. Developers in countries all over the world are using Scala for a large variety of applications across a broad range industies. They are enthusiastic, share a passion for Scala are extremely welcoming to new comers. You will find friendly, knowlegeable people ready to help you from the moment you start learning Scala to the time you become an expert programmer yourself. Some share their experience in blogs, others through the Scala e-mail lists, by participating in Open Development projects, at user group meetings or at Scala conferences. Naturally, the best way to get to know the community is to listen and start talking to them. Perhaps join a [Scala user group close by](http://www.scala-tribes.org).

If you are just starting to learn Scala you will find many useful references on the [Learn]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation) page.

### Mailing Lists

Scala has the following primary mailing lists. For those lists that existed before they were migrated to Google Groups, see the links for complete archives on Gmane.

 * [Scala-User](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-user): the main forum for questions and discussions about the Scala programming
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user)). In particular, newbie questions and programming experiences
  and questions should go to this list.

 * [Scala-Language](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language): the main forum for discussions and news about the Scala
language ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala)).

 * [Scala-Announce](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-announce): announcements of new Scala releases, packages and
 applications ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.announce)).
 * [Scala-Debate](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-debate): a more relaxed list for questions and discussions
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.debate)). In particular, the following should go to this list:

    * questions and suggestions around the future of Scala.
    * trails of discussions that started in scala but become too specialized to be of interest to most readers.
    * topics where you suspect that only a few people would be interested.

 * [Scala-Tools](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-tools): the main forum for discussions about the Scala tools
 contributed by the community ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.tools)).
 * [Scala-Internals](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals): discussions about the core internal design and implementation
 of the Scala system. This list is mainly used by developers who commit code to the Scala code base, but it is open to the general
 public in the interest of transparency. Please only post new threads if you commit to the Scala code base, and you need to discuss
 the internals of the Scala system. Bug reports, feature requests, and general discussions should go to the other lists instead
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.internals)).

 * [Scala-XML](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-xml): interest group devoted to the Scala XML infrastructure
 ([Archive at Gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.xml)).

 * [Scala-SIPs](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips): interest group devoted to the Scala Improvement Process (SIP) proposals.
