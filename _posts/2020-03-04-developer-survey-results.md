title: "Results of the 2019 Scala Developer Survey"
---

You have been about 4 thousands Scala developers to fill the survey and we are grateful
to you! The survey results help us identify the trends in how you use the language in
your day-to-day workflow, and what could be improved in the tooling or ecosystem.

We are happy to share the results with you. They are available at
[https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-developer-survey-2019/](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-developer-survey-2019/).
