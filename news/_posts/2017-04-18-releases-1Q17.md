title: "Three new releases and more GitHub goodness!"
---

We are happy to announce the availability of three new Scala releases: 2.11.11 concludes the 2.11 series, 2.12.2 brings many bug fixes and small improvements, and 2.13.0-M1 sets the scene for the standard library modularization and improvements coming in the next major release, due in a year. Many thanks to everyone who contributed!

As part of our ongoing efforts at Lightbend to simplify contributing to Scala, we are thrilled to announce our move to GitHub for [bug reporting](https://github.com/scala/bug), as well as for [release notes](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases) publishing. For the highlights of each of our three releases, read on.

[Scala 2.11.11](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.11.11) resolves regressions introduced in 2.11.9 and 2.11.10. Special thanks to @xuwei-k and @sjrd for reporting and helping diagnose these. In addition to many smaller fixed and a few backports from 2.12, 2.11.11 features improved error messages on missing dependencies. This improvement was developed by @jvican at the Scala Center under proposal SCP-009.

[Scala 2.12.2](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.2) brings back support for trailing commas, with the first proposal (SIP-27) to make it all the way through the revived Scala Improvement Process. Congratulations, @dwijnand!

[Scala 2.13.0-M1](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.0-M1) prepares for the next phase of the standard library [modularization](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/323) and the [collections rework](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman). The parallel collections are now a separate  [module](https://github.com/scala/scala-parallel-collections), and many deprecated members have been removed. As a reminder, our [full 2.13 roadmap](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/324) is available for review on GitHub.
