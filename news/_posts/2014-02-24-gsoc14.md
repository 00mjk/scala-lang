**This year the Scala team applied again for the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) program to work with enthusiastic students on challenging Scala projects and got accepted.**

## What is Google Summer of Code

Google invites students to come up with interesting, non-trivial problems for their favourite open-source projects and work on them over the summer. Participants get support from the community, plus a mentor who makes sure you don't get lost and that you meet your goals. Aside from the satisfaction of solving challenging problems, students get paid for their work. But wait, there's more! Successful participants also receive an official Google Summer of Code t-shirt! This is an incredible opportunity to get involved in the Scala community and get helpful support along the way.

## How to get involved
First, have a look at our [project ideas page][gsoc2014]. The ideas there are meant as suggestions to serve as a starting point. We expect students to explore the ideas in much more detail, preferably with their own suggestions and detailed plans on how they want to proceed. Don't feel constrained by the provided list! We welcome any of your own challenging ideas, but make sure that the proposed project satisfies the main requirements.

The best place to propose and discuss your proposals is our ["scala-language"](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language) mailing list. This way you will get quickly responses from the whole Scala community.

## Previous Summer of Code

We encourage you to have a look at our [Summer of Code 2010][gsoc2010], [2011][gsoc2011], [2012][gsoc2012] and [2013][gsoc2013] page to get an idea on what we and you can expect while working on Scala.
