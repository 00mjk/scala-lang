### Organizing a Scala Event?

If you are considering organizing a Scala-related conference, we maintain a
private spreadsheet of announced and pre-announcement conferences to help
organizers co-ordinate their plans, and avoid choosing conflicting dates for
their events.

To gain access to the spreadsheet, and share your plans, please contact [Jon
