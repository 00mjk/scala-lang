# SCALA-LANG.ORG

This repository contains the _static_ source of [scala-lang.org](http://scala-lang.org). It does not contain the source of any content found under the [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org) subdomain (instead, visit the [scala.github.com repo](http://github.com/scala/scala.github.com) for that source).

It's a static site generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), and uses a whole host of open-source tools including a touch of Twitter's Bootstrap.

## Dependencies

You'll need Jekyll installed to generate and test the site. To get it, most people can install via RubyGems:

    gem install jekyll

OSX users might have to update RubyGems:

    sudo gem update --system

If in doubt, head over to the [Jekyll wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) for installation instructions.

## Building

After cloning, cd into the `scala/scala-lang` directory and run: 

    jekyll --server

To see the generated site, just visit `http://localhost:4000`.

## YAML Front Matter

The "YAML Front Matter" is nothing more than the header on each page that you intend for Jekyll to parse. It contains information such as the name of the HTML template (layout) chosen for the specific document, and the title of the document. An example YAML front matter might look like:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: My page title
    ---

You can use these fields in the YAML front matter later in your document. For example, to make a header with the title of the document, in markdown you would write:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: My page title
    ---

    # {{ page.title }}

    Body text here...

`# {{ page.title }}` would be rendered in HTML as, `<h1>My page title</h1>`.

## Markdown

There are dozens of guides and cheatsheets that cover markdown syntax out there, though this screenshot from the free OSX markdown editor, [Mou](http://mouapp.com/), is an excellent and concise reference:

### Linking to internal pages

The least error-prone way to link between documents, to link to local images, or anything else: `[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}/path/to/page/page.html)`
