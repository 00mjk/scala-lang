# Learning Scala

The best way to learn Scala depends on what you know already and the way you prefer to learn things. There is a variety of resources available including [books]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/books.html), tutorials, training courses, presentations, and of course the Scala compiler for practice. Many people find a good combination is to have one of the Scala books at hand and to start right away trying the examples with the Scala Compiler. On the other hand, you may want to get started with a Scala [training course](#training) or using the material available online.

As your knowledge of Scala grows, you will find there is more advanced material and a very friendly [Scala community]({{ site.baseurl }}/community/) at hand to help you. They all share a passion for Scala and welcome newcomers warmly. Many have written helpful material for programmers new to Scala, will respond to emails asking for help or are sharing neat new techniques, advanced concepts or tools in one of several Scala forums or personal blogs.


## Scala for Programming Beginners


If you are just starting to learn how to code, you will find that a large portion of the material about Scala assumes that you already have some programming experience. There are two valuable resources which we can recommend to programming beginners that will take you directly into the world of Scala:

* The online class [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), available on coursera. Tought by the creator of Scala, Martin Odersky, this online class takes a somewhat academic approach to teach the fundamentals of functional programming. You will learn a lot of Scala by solving the programming assignments.
* [Kojo](http://www.kogics.net/sf:kojo) is an interactive learning environment that uses Scala programming to explore and play with math, art, music, animations and games.



## The Scala Documentation Site

Your main entry point into online documentation on Scala is the official documentation site, [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org/). It contains a growing number of articles, guides and tutorials. The following list highlights some of the most important documents, but the doc site contains much more than that!

### Scala Tutorial for Java Programmers

Many things you already know from your Java experience directly carry over to the Scala environment. The [Scala Tutorial for Java Programmers](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) is intended for people who already have some programming experience and want an overview of what they can do with Scala.


### Guides for Libraries and Language Features

The section [Guides and Overviews](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/) contains many useful guides about core libraries and features of Scala, for instance about:

* [Scala's Collection Library](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/introduction.html),
* [Futures and Promises](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html), or
* [String Interpolation](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html)


### A Tour of Scala

If you want to learn what Scala is all about and what are its most important and distincitve language features, the [Tour of Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/tour-of-scala.html) is a highly informative document. Note however that a the tour also shows you some of the more advanced features that can be found in Scala, so if you're just beginning, don't worry if you don't understand everything!



## Getting Scala Up and Running

There are multiple ways to get Scala code compiling and running on your machine. The most widely used tools are:

* Your favorite text editor and the command-line [Scala compiler]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/), see the [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/getting-started.html) guide
* IDEs for Scala: The [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/), [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Scala plugin, and [NetBeans IDE](http://netbeans.org/) with the Scala plugin
* Build tools for Scala: [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), maven with the [Scala plugin](http://davidb.github.com/scala-maven-plugin/index.html) or the [Scala plugin for gradle](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/scala_plugin.html)

The **Scala interpreter** (also called the REPL) is a very valuable tool for experimenting with Scala. It is installed together with the command-line compiler and allows you to interactively write and evaluate Scala expressions.

The Scala IDE and IntelliJ IDEA both support **[Scala worksheets](https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet/wiki/Getting-Started)**, interactive Scala documents that are continuously evaluated line-by-line. Worksheets are an excellent way to experiment with Scala while still being able to save your code as in file and reuse it later on.


## Online learning

There are a few interactive tools for trying out Scala, to get a look and feel of the language:

 * [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun): this is a course about functional
 programming given by Martin Odersky himself in autumn 2012. You can access the course material and exercises by
 signing up for the course. (The course will be given again soon..)
 * [Try Simply Scala](http://www.simplyscala.com/): [Simply Scala](http://www.simplyscala.com/) is a web site where you can interactively try Scala. There you will find a tutorial that gives a rapid overview of the basic language features, the syntax, examples you can run and the ability to try your own code with an interactive interpreter.
 * [Kojo](http://kogics.net/kojo-download) is a Scala development environment designed for use in schools. It comes with a Scala tutorial that gives a rapid overview of the basic language features, the syntax, examples you can run and the ability to try your own code. It is simple to [download and install](http://kogics.net/kojo-download).

## Training

If you want to learn Scala in a more official setting, you can always sign up for some quality training. Here below
are some schools you can register to:

 * [Scala Training with Typesafe](http://www.typesafe.com/products/training): [Typesafe](http://www.typesafe.com/) and its partners provide regular Scala training courses and Scala consulting in many locations world-wide. They provide expert teachers, including Iulian Dragos, Heiko Seeberger and other certified Scala trainers, to take you through the Scala language in a systematic way either in group classes at their facilities or on your own site.


## Older documentation

The documentation below may be a bit outdated, but provides insights into the (historical) design principles of
the language :

 * [Brief Scala Tutorial](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf): a 20 page introduction to scala and some of the basic concepts and a good place to start. You will find more code examples [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/219).

 * [Scala By Example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf): takes you through the Scala features with many examples. It does assume that you are already familiar with the basic Scala syntax and a basic understanding of functional programming. It is an excellent way to expand your knowledge and skill.

 * [Scala Overview](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaOverview.pdf): this is a paper summarizing the features of the Scala Language in a formal and concise way. An excellent reference for language researchers or advanced programmers.

 * [Java to Scala with the Help of Experts](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/960): a collection of some of the almost endless supply of tips available for Java programmers new to Scala. There are also mini-blog series designed to take you through many of the important features of the Scala language in a friendly way.

## Research

Scala is also a very useful language to do research on/in. You can find Scala-related publications at the
[LAMP research page](http://lamp.epfl.ch/publications). Other Scala-related research material can be found on the
[Scala Days](http://days2012.scala-lang.org/) website and the [Scala2013](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2013/) workshop website. For an in-depth view of the technical details of the language, you may also find of interest the [Scala Language Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/archive/nightly/pdfs/ScalaReference.pdf).
