---

We're excited to announce the first release of
[Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org), an optimising ahead-of-time
compiler for Scala built on top of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) compiler
infrastracture.

The project was originally announced during Scala Days New York 2016 and
now has reached a point of relative feature completeness.

## What's included

Here are some of the exciting features that got into 0.1:

* Support for the whole Scala language with negligible semantic differences
* Effortless zero-cost interop with native code
* Out-of-the-box support for existing Scala IDEs
* Seamless integration with sbt build tool
* Cross-publishing infrastructure against JVM, JS and Native platforms
* Support for the core subset of the JDK base libraries

More information is available on our
[website](http://www.scala-native.org).

## Road ahead

A list of known issues and upcoming features is available via
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/issues).
