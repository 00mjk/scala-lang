title: "Introducing Non-English Chatrooms for Scala Users"
---

I attend a lot of conferences around the world, and usually all the talks and
most of the communication among attendees happens in English. It has become (if
you'll excuse the irony) the *lingua franca* of the software industry, even
though speakers of English as a first language are a minority.

There are, however, many users and potential users of Scala who either do not
speak English, or do not have the confidence to communicate in public forums in
English, as I discovered recently at a Scala event, where (strangely for me as
an English-speaker who travels the world extensively without ever putting in
much linguistic effort) my second language, French, was a more efficient means
of communicating the ideas we wanted to share.
